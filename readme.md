# Entity Test
This project utilizes [Hephaestus Engine](https://github.com/unnamed/hephaestus-engine) to generate custom entities
To try out the redstone monster simply type out `spawn redstone` in chat and the entity will spawn

Redstone monster is based on Minecraft Dungeons' Redstone Monstrosity and I did not make the model

## How to build
Simply clone the repository and use ```gradlew shadowJar```
